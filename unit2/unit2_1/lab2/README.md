## LAB 2 — Coercion, Truthy/Falsy, Equality Pitfalls

### Objective

To expose real security pitfalls:
- == vs ===

- truthy/falsy

- implicit coercion

---

### Directions

This lab demonstrates common errors that lead to logic flaws in web applications.

- Always use ===.

- All functions should fail securely.


The code must use these concepts:

- implicit cohersion

- truthy / falsy

- strict equality
