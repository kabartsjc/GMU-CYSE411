## LAB 1 — JavaScript Syntax & Semantics (Foundations)

### Objective

To have the student translate their mental model from Python to JavaScript, understanding:

- let vs const

- functions

- objects and arrays

- flow control

---

### Directions

In this lab you will implement basic JavaScript functions using the syntax presented in class.

- Do not use var.

- All functions must be implemented in lab1.js.

You must use these concepts to develop the code:
- const / let
- JS objects vs. Python dictionaries
- flow control
- strict equality (===)
