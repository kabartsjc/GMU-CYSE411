# CYSE 411 – Secure Software Engineering

### Code Examples Repository

This repository contains code examples, hands-on exercises, and supporting materials for CYSE 411 – Secure Software Engineering at George Mason University.

The goal of this repository is to provide students with practical artifacts that complement lectures and labs, enabling them to apply security principles across the software development lifecycle.

---

## 📘 Course Description

CYSE 411 provides a foundation for building secure software by applying security principles to the full software development lifecycle.

Topics include:

- Security in requirements engineering

- Secure design principles

- Risk analysis and threat modeling

- Deployment of cryptographic algorithms

- Defensive coding practices

- Static analysis and security assessment

Students develop **practical skills for building, testing, and evaluating secure software systems**.

Note: This course is especially relevant for students specializing in the software aspects of cybersecurity engineering and requires prior exposure to Systems Engineering and at least one programming language (Java, C++, or Python).

## 🎯 Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Identify and explain the most common web application threats, their technical foundations, and their impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

- Demonstrate exploitation techniques in controlled environments to analyze vulnerabilities, root causes, and security implications.

- Apply structured threat modeling methods such as STRIDE and DREAD to identify and evaluate system risks.

- Integrate security requirements and countermeasures into all phases of the software development lifecycle.

- Apply entrepreneurial mindset principles to propose innovative and high-value security solutions to real-world problems.

- Communicate security analyses and mitigation strategies clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
